## Data Mining 

## Project Description-

**NASA Asteroid Classification**’s main motto is to apply Machine Learning models in order to precisely classify
the hazardous and non-hazardous asteroids. 

This repository hosts a data mining project focused on classifying asteroids using a dataset provided by NASA. The primary objective of this project is to employ data mining techniques to predict whether an asteroid is hazardous or non-hazardous based on its various attributes.

## Dataset for NASA Asteroid Classification

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [NASA Asteroids Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/nasa-asteroids-classification). It includes a collection of features related to asteroids, including their orbital characteristics and physical properties.

## Project Overview

This project follows a systematic workflow, including:

1. **Data Collection:** The dataset is gathered from the provided source and loaded into the project.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing is conducted to ensure the dataset is clean and suitable for analysis. This involves handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and scaling or normalizing the data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The dataset is thoroughly explored through descriptive statistics and data visualizations. EDA helps in understanding the relationships and patterns within the data.

4. **Feature Selection:** Relevant features are selected based on the insights gained during EDA.

5. **Model Selection:** The project employs various data mining algorithms to classify the asteroids. The selected models are tuned to achieve the best performance.

6. **Model Evaluation:** The models are evaluated using appropriate metrics to determine their accuracy and efficiency in classifying asteroids.

7. **Deployment:** The final model can be deployed for future use, and predictions can be made on new, unseen data.

## Technologies-
👉 Python<br>
👉 Google Collab<br>

## Data Mining Techniques

Several data mining techniques can be applied in this project, including:

👉 **Decision Trees:** Used for asteroid classification based on their attributes.<br>
👉 **Random Forest:** An ensemble algorithm to improve classification accuracy.<br>
👉 **Logistic Regression:** Predicts whether an asteroid is hazardous or non-hazardous.<br>
👉 **K-Means Clustering:** Identifies patterns and groups asteroids based on similarities.<br>
